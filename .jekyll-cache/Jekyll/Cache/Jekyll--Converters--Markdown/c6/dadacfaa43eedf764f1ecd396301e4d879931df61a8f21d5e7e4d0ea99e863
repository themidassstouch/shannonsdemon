<p align="justify">How the bot works... Let's start with a portfolio worth 1000 USD and trade BNB/USDT (<b>market</b>). Since we have to start with a perfectly balanced portfolio, we buy 500 USD worth of USDT (<b>quote_asset_qty</b>) and 500 USD worth of BNB (<b>base_asset_qty</b>). At a current price of of 20 BNBUSDT that is 25 BNB. This is also called the equilibrium price.
</p>
<p>T0: 500.0 USDT + 25.00 BNB x 20.0 BNB/USDT = 1000.0 USDT.</p>
<p align="justify">
At T1 the price decreases to 15.0 BNB/USDT and to be perfectly balanced again the bot buys 4.17 BNB in exchange for 62.5 USDT.
</p>
<p>T1: 500.0 USDT + 25.00  BNB x 15.0 BNB/USDT = 875.0 USDT.<br />
T1: Rebalance: buy 4.17 BNB.<br />
T1: 437.5 USDT + 29.17 BNB x 15.0 BNB/USDT = 875.0 USDT.</p>
<p align="justify">
At T2 the price increases to 20.0 BNB/USDT and to be perfectly balanced again the bot sells 3.65 BNB in exchange for 72.92 USDT.
</p>
<p>T2: 437.50 USDT + 29.17 BNB x 20.0 BNB/USDT = 1020.8 USDT.<br />
T2: Rebalance: sell 3.65 BNB.<br />
T2: 510.42 USDT + 25.52 BNB x 20.0 BNB/USDT = 1020.8 USDT.</p>
<p align="justify">
As you can see in the above example we have generated a small retrun of approximately 2%. Over time the bot generates many small returns which are immediately re-invested (similar to receiving compound interest, the 8th world wonder). This is also known as volatility harvesting and if there is plenty of something in the crypto space, it is volatility. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
The given example is a simplified explanation of how the bot works. Actually it starts with sending orders at the equilibrium price multiplied by <b>buy_percentage</b> and <b>sell_percentage</b>. With these parameters equal to 0.9 and 1.1 that would be orders with price of 18 and 22 BNB/USDT at time T0. After waiting <b>sleep_seconds_after_send_orders</b> seconds, the bot cancels all open orders, processes all new (trade id &gt; <b>fromId</b>) trades that were send with this bot and finally waits another <b>sleep_seconds_after_cencel_orders</b> seconds. Every <b>rebalance_interval_sec</b> seconds instead of sending orders at fixed percentages, the bot sends special orders. These special orders rebalance at the current price given that it's more than 5% away from equilibrium.

How you start your bot... Download shannonsdemon.exe and config.json and put both files in the same folder. If you don't trust running an executable, which you shouldn't if you don't have some sort of dedicated system, you can also clone the github repository and run the python script. Open a new account on <a href="https://www.binance.com/nl/register?ref=R9NNDYS8">Binance</a> (or use an existing one) and create API keys (be sure to have trading enabled and withdrawal disabled). Fund your account, make sure you have the right quantities for every market you want to trade and set all parameters in the config.json file.</p>
