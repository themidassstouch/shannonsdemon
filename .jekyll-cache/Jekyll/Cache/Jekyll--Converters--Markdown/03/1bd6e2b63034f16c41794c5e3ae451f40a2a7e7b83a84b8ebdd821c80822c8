Welcome to the homepage of Shannon's Demon. The bot that grows the value of your crypto portfolio exponentially. This is done by repeatedly rebalancing your portfolio such that for every pair (e.g. BNBUSDT) you decide to trade 50% of portfolio value is allocated to asset A (BNB) and the other 50% is allocated to asset B (USDT) </p>
<p align="justify">
Asset A is sold in exchange for asset B when the price of asset A relative to the price of Asset B goes up. It buys back asset A when the price relative to the price of asset B moves down again. Hereby generating a small profit. This is also known as volatility harvesting and if there is plenty of something in the crypto space it is volatility. For more information about this strategy, that is also known as Shannon's Demon, please read: [rebalancing-with-shannons-demon](https://thepfengineer.com/2016/04/25/rebalancing-with-shannons-demon/).

Under certain assumptions, it can be proved that there is no other strategy that generates higher returns in the long run than Shannon's Demon does. Over time it generates many small returns which are immediately re-invested. This is like receiving compound interest. You won't get rich quick but you will get rich slow. </p>

<h1 id="get-the-bot-started">GET THE BOT STARTED:</h1>
<p align="justify">
Please find instructions on how to use this bot below. At the moment the bot only works on Binance. Above picture shows an example of a bot running for three different pairs. This example is referenced throughout the instructions. Below you can find a picture of the config.json file needed to start the bot in the example. Adding more or different pairs should be straightforward after reading the instructions. 
</p>

<h2 id="set-up-a-trading-account">SET UP A TRADING ACCOUNT.</h2>
<p align="justify">
1. Open a trading account on the Binance exchange. Please use this [**[link]**](https://www.binance.com/nl/register?ref=R9NNDYS8) as you receive a 10% discount on trading fees Actually the discount is 20% but 10% is donated to us. In my opinion it is easiest to have a new (empty) account used solely for this bot as it makes initializing, debugging, allocating value to different portfolios (pairs) and PnL calculations much easier. Obviously you can use an existing account also.   
</p>
<p align="justify">
2. Create api keys for your account. The bot needs the trading option to be enabled, it is disabled by default. Please make sure to disable the withdrawal option for obvious reasons. Find instructions on how to create api keys on Binance here: [**create api keys**](https://www.binance.com/en/support/articles/360002502072)
</p>
<p align="justify">
3. Fund your account and buy the pairs that you want to trade. For example if you want to start trading pair BNBUSDT, you should make sure that you have 16.29 BNB and 240.2775 USDT as 16.29 * 14.75 (=price BNBUSDT) equals 240.2775. This way you are perfectly balanced as 50% of total value is allocated to each asset.
</p>

<h2 id="installing-the-bot">INSTALLING THE BOT.</h2>

<p align="justify">
1. Download shannonsdemon.exe and config.json from the github repository master branch. Running the python script (shannonsdemon.py) will not be covered as somebody with enough knowledge should be able to set it up him- or herself easily.
</p>
<p align="justify">
2. Put the executable and the config file in the same folder.
</p>
<p align="justify">
3. After filling the config file, which we will cover in the next step, you can start the bot simply by double clicking the executable.
</p>
<h2 id="setting-the-config-file">SETTING THE CONFIG FILE.</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>Download either shannonsdemon.exe and config.json or create python project by cloning repository master branch (or any other way). The python project assumes you know how to create one, feel free to set it up any way you like. If you choose the first option, be sure to put both files in the same folder. If you choose the latter, be sure to put the config file in the working directory so script can find it.</li>
      <li>Update the config.json file:</li>
      <li>Put STATE to ‚ÄúTEST‚Äù. This let‚Äôs you run the tool as it would do in TRADE state but prevents sending real orders to the exchange. This way you can see if your settings are ok Only if you are sure of the correct settings change STATE to ‚ÄúTRADE‚Äù</li>
      <li>Enter api public and secret key</li>
      <li>Put sleep_seconds_after_send_orders, sleep_seconds_after_cancel_orders and rebalance_interval_sec to 180, 60 and 1080. This way the bot waits 180 sec after sending orders. Then wait 60 sec after cancelling orders. Every 1080 seconds the bot rebalances no matter how far away the market price is from the equilibrium price (=price at which you are perfectly balanced). However not if it is less than 5% away as you have to make up for fees too.</li>
      <li>Enter all pairs (markets) that the bot should trade. Please see config.json as example. Be carefull: fromID should be 0 only when you first initialize. It keeps strack of the trades it already processed. The buy and sell percentage lets you set the price of your orders as a percentage away from the equilibrium price. The base and quote asset quantity lets you set the amount of coins that you want to allocate to this portfolio. For the example below, you are at equilibrium if the price is 98.5 / 27285.79 = 0.00360994.</li>
      <li>Start your bot by double clicking the .exe or run python script. Be sure to first start with STATE set to something different than TRADE, TEST for example.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
